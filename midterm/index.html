<h3>About Me:</h3>
  <p>I'm Kate, a Cybersecurity and Global Policy major in the Indiana University Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering and the Hamilton Lugar School of International Studies. I would like to work in policy analysis one day, but I am currently searching for a cybersecurity internship in the private sector. I code proficiently in Java, Python and HTML and have extensive Slack, GitHub and Microsoft teams experience. I am a self-motivated team player, as indicated by my strong academic record and devotion to others through free coding lessons and service dog training. At Indiana University, I serve as the Diversity Initiatives Program Coordinator on the Luddy Living Community’s leadership board and am involved with the Women in Computing and Women in Cybersecurity clubs on campus. I am currently conducting research with the Department of State’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and have become interested in the importance of Human Rights in AI legislation. I am passionate about reaching equity in STEM and working for criminal justice reform. <p>

<button onclick = "window.location.href = 'csCreate/homePage.html'"> A.P. CSP </button>
<p>To view a site I created this for my college applications, click the "Application" button above. Some schools now allow students to share a portfolio with admissions counselors, so I coded this site to make my application feel more personal and showcase my HTML/CSS skills. If you hover over each image you will find a brief description. </p>
<p>To view a site I created for my AP Computer Science Principles Create Project, click the "AP CSP" button above. I created three sites using HTML, CSS and JS in the style of Buzzfeed quizzes. We had complete create liberty for the assignemt. Our AP score was determined by the program's application of concepts we learned in the course.</p>
